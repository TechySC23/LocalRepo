## What is this?

LocalRepo is a website that contains all the information about html and css. It is a great resource for anyone who wants to learn front end development.

I wanted to learn Front end Development and I wanted to teach the entire world how to write cool websites! I made this repository to grab the all the knowledge and code from the internet and put it at one place for easy convenience for everyone.

## Versioning System

This project uses this type of versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.SNAPSHOT | This Means: MAJOR - V1, V2, V3, etc. MINOR - 0.***1***, 0.***2***, 0.***3***, etc. PATCH - 0.0.***1***, 0.0.***2***, 0.0.***3***, etc. SNAPSHOT - 0.0.0.***A***, 0.0.0.***B***, 0.0.0.***C***, etc.

We are currently updating the repo to match the new versioning system.
It previously followed the SemVer kind of system: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, but not using the major version making it kind of like: 0.MAJOR.MINOR and the commits as patches.

> [!Important]
> Semver Will NEVER be used in this repo, as it is inconvenient to use.
> And it creates technical challenges like converting the version system.
