        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>Local Repo is a website where everybody can learn the code simply by learning the examples. I believe that
          everybody should learn web development regardless of whether AI can replace developers (especially web
          developers) or not. </p>

        <h2>
          Why?
        </h2>
        <p>
          <b> I am learning web development</b> because I want to make websites, and teach the world how to make 
          complex as well as easy websites for various purposes like making their portfolio or blogs for free. Learning 
          Websites makes it easy to make complex websites for things like showcasing some IRL project and etc. Without 
          having to use paid or even free website builders like Wix or Wordpress, for simple things, you can use them 
          but, the problem is that you have to pay for the domain name or hosting. But, with your own hand coded 
          websites, you can host them on Github Pages for free. And the level of customization you get is UNMATCHABLE  
          to those website builders. And watermarks? FORGET THEM! JavaScript isnt even available in Wordpress!

          Way to teaching web dev
        </h2>
        <p>
					currently learning web development by learning HTML, CSS, and	JavaScript, these three together 
          are called Front End Development Languages, or simply, Front End development. I am also learning
          VCS (Version Control System) like Git, which is a tool that helps you manage your code.
